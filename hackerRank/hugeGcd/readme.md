Gayasen has received a homework assignment to compute the greatest common divisor of the two positive integers A and B. Since the numbers are quite large, the professor provided him with N smaller integers whose product is A, and M integers with product B. He would like to verify result, so he has asked you to write a program to solve his problem. But instead of printing complete answer you have to print answer modulo 109+7.

Input
First line of input contains the positive integer N (1 <= N <= 1000).
Second line of input contains N space-separated positive integers not greater than 104, whose product is the number A.
Third line of input contains the positive integer M (1 <= M <= 1000).
Fourth line of input contains M space-separated positive integers not greater than 104, whose product is the number B.

OUTPUT
Print the greatest common divisor of numbers A and B modulo 1000000007.

Constraints
1 <= N, M <= 1000
1 <= element of list <= 10000
